  <p> Integrating indoor or outdoor attractions into a resort or hotel has a
     huge impact on the property by keeping guests on the property
     longer and increasing room occupancy based on additional onsite amenities.
     Including exciting attractions such as a waterpark or an adventure play
     course adjacent to your accommodations can transform your hotel into a
     destination, meaning guests wonâ€™t look elsewhere for their entertainment,
      and make weekend stays attractive to local families.<br> Bamburich resort
      offers this and a whole lot more!</p>
